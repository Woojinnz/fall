SISFALL dataset
I used the accelerometer data from ADXL345 sampled at 200HZ.

I consider the data from fall trials by elderly people.

Raw accelerometer readings are in sensor bits -> translate this using the resolution and range

We are only interested in the magnitude of the total acceleration so we can use the sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)

I then remove 1 g due to gravity. (1g = 9.81ms^-2)

Strictly just looking at this data I looked at the peaks. (the peak data is the exact acceleration at impact)

Falls (75 falls)
median = 2.95, 25th percentile = 1.9

NonFalls(893 trials)
median = 0.62 75th percentile = 1.15

Fall peaks (g):
count    75.000000
mean      3.156145
std       1.658264
min       0.705064
25%       1.902128
50%       2.947381
75%       4.128152
max       8.146177

ADL peaks (g) (non falls):
count    893.000000
mean       0.940364
std        0.979626
min        0.079135
25%        0.316730
50%        0.616215
75%        1.154388
max        8.894206


So from this we can see between 1.2 ~ 1.9 g is when ADL end and where most falls Stops

some overlap occurs here which may be problamatic for false positive


Possible ways to improve this

Add gyroscope (anuglar velocity) 

Check inactivity -> see if acceleration is low for 1s after a high acceleration (could be sitting down?)

Free fall detection = check for acceleration dipping below a treshold.
                                                                    
So we check for a free fall time period -> Impact spike

During the free fall time, there is no no acceleration (something close to 0)
Then on impact the reading will spike as the object will decelerate from its fall speed to zero
Hence a spike will be seen

Looking at the image fall_over_time.png we can see a clear three phase pattern
